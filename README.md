### Introduction
This project deals with development of a database driven E-commerce system using django and SQL. It provides users with a list of products available for purchases in the store. To ensure maximum convenience in online shopping, a shopping cart is provided to the user. After a user selects the preferred products, they are sent for order confirmation process. Django has been used in the implementation because it is fast, security assurance and its ability to quickly and flexibly scale. However, few challenges came along.

In future, additional features will be incorporated including a search box and payment module.
